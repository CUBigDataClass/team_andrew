# team_andrew

Had an issue with original "test_scraper.py" This is fixed version for me with pymongo to connect MongoDB with python and sample website using Flask.

1. Run "python3 -m flask run" on src folder path to open up local sample website with Flask.
2. Upload any photo and click submit button.
3. It will save the uploaded photo as "temp.jpg" in local "images" folder. 
4. "cd.." to go to "team_andrew" folder with test_scraper.py.
5. Run "python3 .\test_scraper.py" on terminal.
6. Open up MongoDB cluster with "mongodb+srv://team_andrew:Green91%40%40@cluster1.jsqyd.mongodb.net/test"
7. You can see the added documents using image scrapping in ImageSearch.ImageData.

So far this is what I got.
